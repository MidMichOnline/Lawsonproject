# A Second Look at “Small Wonder”

()[fixingabrain-800px.png]

I remember killing time as a kid watching the syndicated shows which would air on the UHF channels on a Saturday afternoon. Usually, I would have turned on the TV out of sheer boredom and begin “surfing” the channels to see if anything good was on. Sometimes, I would turn on the TV in anticipation of something in particular—like a rerun of “Star Trek,” or later “Star Trek: The Next Generation”—and would catch the last few minutes of whatever happened to air before it.

Some of the shows I remember watching on Saturdays were “Charles in Charge,” “Out of this World,” as well as the second-run syndicated programs like “Mork and Mindy.” For example, I watched reruns  of “Three's Company,” “Mork and Mindy,” and “Happy Days” in June 1993 on my last day of high school as a senior.

I'm fairly sure that “Small Wonder” was a show that would come up during my channel surfing, but I don't know that I was ever too engrossed by it. There are enough science fiction elements that I might have become a fan if I had given it a chance: the Lawsons try to live a normal life while keeping the fact that their 10-year-old daughter Vicki is actually a robot which was built by Mr. Lawson, who is also a robotics expert.

Over twenty five years have passed since this show first aired, and I definitely hadn't given it a lot of thought. That was up until a week ago when we watched an episode at my mom's house. The TV had just been on, and out of a sense of novelty we tuned it to a sub digital channel called ME-TV. “Small Wonder” was preceded by other classics such as “The Monkees,” “The Partridge Family,” and “Mr. Ed.” In just that morning, it was as if we had traveled from the 1960's all of the way up to the 1980's via my parent's television set.

Okay, so I'll admit that at first I was taken back by how bad of a show “Small Wonder” really was. But then something really strange happened: I became curious to see what the other episodes were like, and how it ended. I even googled the show and learned new information about its production.

I'll be the first to say it. I've become a little obsessed.

As I've been watching the episodes of the show for free on YouTube, I think there are a lot of things about it which have captured my fascination. First of all, in a strange way it represents a piece of my past. If I watch enough episodes, I might relive a familiar experience I once had as a kid. Second, the show is an interesting commentary on technology—or, at least, how technology was viewed back then. For example, the Lawson family make phone calls from a *corded* phone that's mounted on the wall in their kitchen. There was a reference by a secondary character to a car phone. And the computer concepts which are used on the show to make Vicky the robot sound super sophisticated are often laughable by today's standards.

It's all *so* antiquated, yet at the same time it feels nostalgic. Perhaps it speaks to a part of me that misses my youth, or yearns for a time when the Internet hadn't been invented yet. Or, perhaps I am more fascinated with the potential of “Small Wonder” were it given a second chance. Instead of being openly mechanical, what if Vicky had been passably human much like Data from TNG or Cameron from “Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.” Or, if the show had explored the true nature of artificial intelligence, such as whether or not robots have a soul, and the morality of substituting a child with an automaton.

“The Lawson Project” is intended to be many different things. From an exploration of the episodes, to the stories behind the production, to other shows or movies which explored the idea of androids built to resemble kids. Ultimately I'm hoping to go deeper into the ideas that are sparked by this old show from the 1980's.
